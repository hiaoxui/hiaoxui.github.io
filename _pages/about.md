My name is Guanghui Qin (秦光辉).
I work at the Health Futures team at Microsoft Research, Redmond. 
My research focuses on multimodal machine learning for clinical diagnosis and precision health.

I obtained my Ph.D. in 2024 from Johns Hopkins University in natural language processing, advised by Professor [Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/).
Before my Ph.D. program, I obtained a bachelor's degree in physics at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2019.
I used to work as a research intern at Microsoft Research (mentored by [Corby Rosset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/corbyrosset/)),
Microsoft Semantic Machines (mentored by [Anthony Platanios](https://platanios.org/)),
and Microsoft Research Asia (mentored by [Chin-Yew Lin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cyl/)).
I was a visiting student at Johns Hopkins University in 2018, mentored by [Hongyuan Mei](https://www.hongyuanmei.com/) and [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/).

My email address is `hiaoxui` followed by `@gmail.com`.

## My research

My current research focuses on AI for healthcare.
Most recently, I work on oncological diagnosis with multimodal machine learning.

In the past, I worked on efficient language modeling (thesis topic), information extraction, prompting (for which I won the Best Short Paper award in NAACL 2021), time-series analysis, and grounded language acquisition.

## Walless

I am also known as *hiaoxui*, the founder of [WallessPKU](https://wallesspku.com/blog/about/).
Walless is a platform that helps Chinese students to circumvent [the Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall).
For over 8 years, I have been developing and funding this non-profit project that benefits tens of thousands of people to access the internet without censorship.
