I am a fifth year Ph.D. student at [Center for Speech and Langauge Processing, Johns Hopkins University](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/).
I study natural language processing (NLP), advised by [Prof. Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/). 

Before my Ph.D. study, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Physics (with a double major in computer science) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).
For internship, I visited Microsoft Research Asia (mentored by [Chin-Yew Lin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cyl/)), Semantic machines (mentored by [Anthony Platanios](https://platanios.org/)), and Microsoft Research at Redmond (mentored by [Corby Rosset](https://http://corbyrosset.com/)).
I was also a visiting student at Johns Hopkins University in 2018, mentored by [Hongyuan Mei](https://hongyuanmei.com/) and [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/).

## My research

I am interested in language representation, especially for long texts.
I aim to represent the text in a structured manner rather than token-wise representation like vanilla Transformers.
I also work on its applications, such as efficient language models.

In the past, I worked on other fields such as (ordered by reversed time):
information extraction, prompting (for which I won the Best Short Paper award in NAACL 2021), time-series analysis, and data-to-text generation.

## Walless

I am more known as *hiaoxui*, who developed [Walless(PKU)](https://wallesspku.com/blog/about/).
Walless is a platform that helps Chinese netizens to circumvent [Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall).
For over 7 years, I have been developing and funding this non-profit project to help
tens of thousands people to access the global internet without censorship.

## My name

My name is 秦光辉 in Chinese.
*Guang'hui* has 2 parts, pronounced like **kwang-huei**.
*Qin* is like **Chin**.
