I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at [Center for Speech and Language Processing, Johns Hopkins University](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/).
I study natural language processing (NLP), and I am advised by [Prof. Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/). 

Before my Ph.D. program, I obtained a bachelor's degree in physics (primary) and computer science (secondary) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).
I used to work as a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (mentored by [Chin-Yew Lin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cyl/)) working on grounded language acquisition,
Microsoft Semantic Machines (mentored by [Anthony Platanios](https://platanios.org/)) working on graph neural networks,
and Microsoft Research Lab at Redmond (mentored by [Corby Rosset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/corbyrosset/)) working on large language models.
I was a visiting student at Johns Hopkins University in 2018, mentored by [Hongyuan Mei](https://hongyuanmei.com/) and [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/).

**Update**: I will join [Microsoft Health Futures](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-health-futures/). See you in Redmond!

## My research

I am interested in language representation, especially for long texts.
I aim to represent the text in a structured manner rather than token-wise representation like vanilla Transformers.
I also work on its applications, such as efficient language models.

In the past, I worked on other fields such as (ordered by reversed time):
information extraction, prompting (for which I won the *Best Short Paper* award in NAACL 2021), time-series analysis, and data-to-text generation.

## Walless

I am more known as *hiaoxui*, the founder of [WallessPKU](https://wallesspku.com/blog/about/).
Walless is a platform that helps Chinese netizens to circumvent [the Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall).
For over 7 years, I have been developing and funding this non-profit project to help
tens of thousands of people to access the internet without censorship.

## My name

My name is 秦光辉 in Chinese.
*Guang'hui* is pronounced like **kwang-huei**.
*Qin* is like **Chin**.
